# ESP8266 Mqtt Bluemix
## Connect ESP8266 to IBM Bluemix cloud using MQTT protocol
MQTT is a light weight message protocol widely used in IOT applications.We use MQTT to send data from ESP8266 to Bluemix.In the Bluemix we use Node-Red service.

## What is ESP8266
The ESP8266 is a low-cost Wi-Fi chip with full TCP/IP stack and MCU (microcontroller unit) capability produced by Shanghai-based Chinese manufacturer, Espressif Systems. The chip first came to the attention of western makers in August 2014 with the ESP-01 module, made by a third-party manufacturer, AI-Thinker. This small module allows microcontrollers to connect to a Wi-Fi network and make simple TCP/IP connections using Hayes-style commands.
